  "content": "“To have another language is to possess a second soul.” Charlemagne (742–814)\n\nAs a language teacher, it pains me to witness and say this: the UK is quietly dismantling its relationship with language learning. And the consequences reach far beyond classrooms.\n\nWe know - and research confirms - that learning another language strengthens cognitive development, sharpens memory, builds empathy, boosts career prospects, and deepens cultural awareness. And yet, despite all these proven benefits, languages are becoming an endangered subject in Great Britain. And not because students are uninterested or incapable, but because the system around them is quietly withdrawing its support.\n\nA SHRINKING LANDSCAPE: UNIVERISTIES CLOSING THEIR MFL DEPARTMENTS\n<img src=\"https://hxzxyrlkaczsmhgf.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/blog/1765215670873-387199468-what-do-you-think-the-decline-of-modern-foreign-languages-v0-b5241sbd0o1f1-Q8J8UYu5g1yOR03z36hhCVT78JpP39.webp\" alt=\"The Slow Erosion of Language Learning In The UK, And Why It Should Worry Us All.\" class=\"w-full h-full object-cover object-center\">\n![The Slow Erosion of Language Learning In The UK, And Why It Should Worry Us All.](https://hxzxyrlkaczsmhgf.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/blog/1765215670873-387199468-what-do-you-think-the-decline-of-modern-foreign-languages-v0-b5241sbd0o1f1-Q8J8UYu5g1yOR03z36hhCVT78JpP39.webp)\n\nThe situation has become so severe that even universities, traditionally the backbone of language scholarship, are cutting entire language departments.\nRecently, several institutions have made headlines for suspending or planning to close Modern Foreign Languages:\n\n- University of Nottingham suspended all undergraduate MFL and music courses for new students, citing financial pressures and declining enrolment (2025).\n- University of Leicester launched a consultation to halt new entrants for MFL and film studies from 2026–27.\n- Cardiff University explored cuts to MFL, music, and nursing as part of cost-saving measures earlier in 2025.\n- University of Aberdeen, and before them Hull, Anglia Ruskin, Liverpool John Moores, all reduced or eliminated languages, contributing to what experts now call \"linguistic deserts\" across the UK.\n\nThis isn’t happening in isolation. It’s the result of a long chain reaction that began years ago when the government made MFL optional at GCSE in 2004. Since then, fewer students have taken languages at GCSE, which means fewer at A level, which means fewer at university… until departments can no longer justify their existence.\n\nThe “societal shift” universities cite is not organic. It’s systemic.\n\nINSIDE SCHOOLS: TOO FEW TEACHERS, YET TOO FEW OPPORTUNITIES\n\nFrom inside the classroom, the picture is just as troubling. As an MFL teacher myself, I have repeatedly seen language teachers asked to teach languages they don’t even speak. Not because schools are careless, but because there simply aren’t enough qualified teachers to fill the roles. And yet, paradoxically, there are almost no MFL teaching jobs advertised.\n\nHow do we reconcile a teacher shortage with a vacancy shortage? Simple: schools are reducing provision because languages are no longer seen as essential.\n\nSo students are given the message, explicitly or implicitly, that languages are “nice to have,” a kind of academic decoration rather than a valuable skill. Ambitious students who do want to study languages at A level are often discouraged because they’re told it’s too risky, too hard, or not useful enough. Why pursue French, Spanish, or German if the universities themselves are shutting their doors?\n\nA CULTURAL MINDSET THAT DOES NOT SUPPORT LANGUAGES\n\nIn my opinion, though, one of the biggest obstacles is cultural.\n\nIn the UK, many children grow up hearing the same refrain: “Why learn another language? Everyone speaks English anyway.”\nParents repeat it. Students absorb it. And because the school system hasn’t invested in countering this myth, many young people genuinely don’t see the point.\n\nIn many European countries like France, Italy or Spain, the media landscape itself nurtures curiosity for other languages: international music on the radio, multilingual artists on mainstream TV, exposure to foreign films and accents, and a strong awareness of Europe and the wider world. \n\nFrance requires radio stations to play what they call, a significant percentage of French-language music... typically around 35-40% (only!). In Scandinavian countries, for example, major movies are not dubbed, but shown in their original language with subtitles. In the UK, however, we overwhelmingly consume English-language media. When was the last time you heard a song in a language other than English on the radio?\n\nChildren in multilingual families, especially in diverse cities like London, often grow up hearing more than one language, giving them an invaluable advantage. But most children in the UK only hear English at home and in the media, and schools are not counterbalancing this. With so little exposure, they don’t get to see why learning another language is important or empowering.\n\nLanguage learning is treated as something difficult, boring, or reserved for an academic elite, and the system reinforces this at every level.\n\nWHAT STUDENTS ARE NOT BEING TOLD ABOUT THE FUTURE\n\nHere’s the irony: we’re pushing children into STEM subjects with the promise that they’ll secure the “careers of the future,” while completely overlooking the reality that many of these fields are becoming increasingly automated.\n\nMathematical problems? AI can already solve them.\nRigid, formulaic tasks? Machines handle them effortlessly.\nScience and maths are wonderful, but they aren’t built on interpretation, and that is exactly where AI thrives.\n\nLanguage, on the other hand, deals with meaning, nuance, ambiguity, culture, humanity. It requires understanding context, emotion, intention... all things that machines struggle to truly replicate.\n\nLanguages open doors to complex cultural universes, new ways of thinking, and new identities. They teach us empathy, flexibility, and perspective - skills desperately needed in an interconnected world.\n\nYet we are quietly steering students away from them.\n\nWHAT WE GAIN WHEN WE INVEST IN LANGUAGES.\n\nLearning a language doesn’t just teach grammar and vocabulary. It teaches students:\n- how to understand a different worldview\n- how to navigate nuance\n- how to communicate across cultures\n- how to see themselves from the outside\n- how to think more flexibly\n- how to belong in a global community\n\nThese are not “nice extras.” They are life skills, professional skills, human skills.\n\nAnd in a world where international communication is the holy grail of modern life, it is appalling that we are phasing out one of the few disciplines that explicitly trains students to communicate.\n\nA CALL TO RE-EXAMINE OUR PRIORITIES\n\nWe cannot keep telling students that languages don’t matter, then wonder why our economy lacks multilingual professionals.\nWe cannot keep closing MFL departments, then pretend to be global leaders.\nWe cannot keep deprioritising languages in schools while expecting young people to thrive in a world that is more connected than ever before.\n\nLanguage learning delivers far more than translation skills. It shapes minds, expands horizons, and builds bridges.\n\nWhen we push it aside, we don’t just lose vocabulary.\nWe lose curiosity.\nWe lose cultural confidence.\nWe lose a vital part of what makes us human.\n\nAnd that is the real tragedy.",
